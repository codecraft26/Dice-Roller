-Reformat your code and clean up your code.
-Add a Button in an Android app using the Layout Editor.
-Modify the MainActivity.kt class to add interactive behavior to the app.
-Pop up a Toast message as a temporary solution to verify you're on the right track.
-Set an on-click listener for a Button using setOnClickListener() to add behavior for when a Button is clicked.
-When the app is running, you can update the screen by calling methods on the TextView, Button, or other UI elements in the layout.
-Comment your code to help other people who are reading your code understand what your approach was.
